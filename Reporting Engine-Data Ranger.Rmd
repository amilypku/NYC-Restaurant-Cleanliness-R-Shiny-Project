Introduction
=====================================  


Based on DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results, this report contains information on violation trends in different locations, seasons, cusine types and violation information of unique restaurants. 

Aiming to solve information asymmetry issue in NYC food industry, this report allowed restaurant consumers to make informed decisions on where they want to eat and motivated NYC restaurants to improve their inspection score in order to attract more customers. It also provides insights for health department to improve their inspection procedures. 

Click on the tabs to see different reports.

Shiny dashboard: 
Introduction and Purpose: 

We built a shiny dashboard to display the information investigated above. 
The shiny can be used by users provide them with information of restaurant violations so that they can make better and more informed decisions about dining out. 
Our dashboard can also be used by the department of health to plan their inspections so that they can target the right restaurants and plan their visits efficiently. 
If the violation information of each restaurant is available to the users, it will also motivate the restaurants improve their inspection score as an increase in the violation score would have a direct impact on their business. 

Shiny- Violations 

Under the violations tab of the shiny users can filter the information for critical or non-critical violations and select the number of cuisines. They can also filter information of the grade A restaurants with different violations types. 

Shiny-  Map Suggestions

Under the map suggestions tab the users can get violation information for the restaurants around NYC. The map provides users with information of the total violations of each restaurant during the period they choose and the exact location of the restaurant. We use the most recent grade of a restaurant to be the grade in its information. The dot gets darker as the number of violations of each restaurant increases. 

Shiny-  Model

We also built a logistic regression model in Shiny to help us have better understanding of the factors that may influence Grade. Each time we could choose two type of grades to build a model that could study the influence of factor variables on them. Comparing to build a multinomial logistic regression which can only compare the odds of one type with baseline type, our model in Shiny could easily between the difference between any subset of grades. This is more flexible and contains more information.
